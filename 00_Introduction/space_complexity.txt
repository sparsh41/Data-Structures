O notation - the slowest the algorithm can run
Omega notation - the fastest the algorithm can run

Space complexity: The amount of memory an algorithm requires realtive to the size of the input
    Fixed space: O(1)
    Variable space: Grows with input

    Steps to analyze:
        Identify all data structures
        Calculate their sizes in terms of n
        Take the sum

    For arrays and vectors, the space complexity is linear, or O(n)
    Matrices have space complexity O(n^2)

    Linked lists - A collection of independent memory nodes that share a link
        Linked by address of the next element, which is stored in the current
        Null address value represents the end of the list
